# sMorph: Dynamic Signal Morphing Framework

sMorph is a wireless communication security framework designed to reduce the probability of interception by dynamically altering signal attributes. It combines cyber deception and moving target defense strategies to thwart adversaries using machine learning or advanced signal classification techniques.

## Features
- **Dynamic Signal Morphing**: Introduces quantum-resistant, high-entropy alterations in signal attributes.
- **No Bandwidth Overhead**: Maintains bandwidth efficiency while applying morphing techniques.
- **Robust Security**: Prevents interception attempts even from advanced machine and deep learning-based attacks.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with existing wireless communication protocols.
- **Open Source**: Includes a labeled dataset and sample attack models to evaluate and extend the framework.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**: Supports Software-Defined Radios (e.g., USRP devices).
- **Software**: 
  - Python 3.7+
  - GNU Radio
  - Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch

## Evaluation Methods
The evaluation utilized advanced machine learning and transformer-based models from Hugging Face, including:
- **GPT-2**: A generative pre-trained transformer used for analyzing signal patterns.
- **DistilBERT**: A lightweight, transformer-based model used for efficient classification tasks.

## Prototype Status
**Under Construction**: The sMorph prototype is currently being refined for public release.
